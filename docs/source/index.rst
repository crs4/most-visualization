Welcome to MOST's Visualization Module documentation
====================================================

The MOST project aims to achieve an open, modular and scalable solution for the creation, execution and management of remote clinical consultations with direct interaction between specialists.

The project consists of a set of frameworks that deal with different aspects and technologies useful for the creation of telemedicine applications.

Visualization Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Visualization Framework allows you to include into your mobile applications visual and interactive widgets capable of rendering , inspecting and changing properties of IStream objects.
This framework internally uses the `Android Touch Gallery Library  <https://github.com/Dreddik/AndroidTouchGallery>`_  for rendering images and the `MOST Streaming Library  <https://github.com/crs4/most-streaming>`_ for managing audio/video streams.
